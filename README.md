# Integrated_Project_2
## *This was an Integrated skill project for TripleTen. 👩🏽‍💻*
This project developed a machine learning solution for predicting gold recovery at the rougher and final stages of ore processing using datasets with over 80 parameters. A Multi-Output Random Forest Regression model provided the most accurate predictions during training, with Linear Regression as a viable, less computationally intensive alternative. Despite underperforming compared to constant benchmarks on the test set, the models demonstrate the potential for data-driven optimization of industrial processes.

## Installation & Usage
* This project uses pandas, numpy, RandomForestRegressor, MultiOutputRegressor, LinearRegression, mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, make_scorer, matplotlib.pyplot, shuffle, StandardScaler, seaborn, SimpleImputer, cross_val_score, KFold, and RandomizedSearchCV.  It requires python 3.9.6.  There is one additional file containing the full, unsplit test set that I was unable to upload due to upload limitations.
